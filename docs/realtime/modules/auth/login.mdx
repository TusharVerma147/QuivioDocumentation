## Overview

The Login Screen allows users to:

- Input their Username, Password, and Organization Code.
- View error messages for invalid inputs.
- Toggle password visibility.
- Navigate through fields using the keyboard.
- Authenticate with the backend API.
- View a loading indicator during authentication.

## Key Features

- **User Input Fields**: Floating input fields for username, password, and organization code.
- **Validation**: Real-time validation for empty fields with error messages.
- **Password Toggle**: Allows toggling password visibility.
- **API Integration**: Sends login data to the backend API.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loader during API calls.
- **Carousel**: Displays a sliding carousel of features for the application.

## Code Structure

### Imports

The screen imports several utilities and components such as:

- **Custom Components**: CustomButton, CustomLoader, FloatingInput.
- **Hooks**: useAppThunkDispatch, useRefs, useSimpleReducer.
- **Redux**: loginApi, loginReducer, userReducer.
- **Services**: AnalyticsService, network.
- **Utilities**: colors, getHp, getWp.
- **Third-party Libraries**: Carousel, AsyncStorage.

### State Management

The screen uses a simple reducer hook, useSimpleReducer, to manage component state:

```javascript
const InitialState: InitialStateType = {
  isLoading: false,
  userName: '',
  password: '',
  orgCode: '',
  showPassword: true,
  nameError: '',
  userNameError: '',
  passwordError: '',
  orgCodeError: '',
  disable: true,
};

const [state, updateState] = useSimpleReducer({
  ...InitialState,
});
```
### Event Handlers

- **onPressLoginButton**: Validates inputs and triggers the API call for login.
- **_getAuthTokenss**: Handles the authentication process, including API call, error handling, and state updates.

### API Integration

The loginApi is dispatched with a payload containing the username, password, and organization code. Successful responses store data in Redux and AsyncStorage.

### Analytics

Logs events for login clicks, success, and failure using AnalyticsService.

## Navigation

On successful login, navigates to the Home Screen.
