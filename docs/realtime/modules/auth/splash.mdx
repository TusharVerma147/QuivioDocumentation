## Overview

The Splash Screen:

- Displays an animated splash screen with the app logo and build version.
- Configures and retrieves device-specific data such as time zone and unique device ID.
- Determines navigation flow based on user authentication status.
- Logs analytics events for user activity tracking.

## Key Features

- **Animated Transition**: Fades in the app logo for a polished visual effect.
- **Device Configuration**: Retrieves or generates a unique device ID and sets the time zone.
- **Authentication Check**: Determines navigation to the main app or login screen.
- **Analytics Integration**: Logs app open events and device-specific details.
- **Permissions**: Requests user tracking permissions for analytics.

## Code Structure

### Imports

The screen imports several utilities and components such as:

- **Redux**: seAppSelector for state selection.
- **Services**: AnalyticsService for event logging.
- **Utilities**: Permissions, colors, normalize, network.
- **Libraries**: react-native-splash-screen, react-native-async-storage/async-storage, and react-native-get-random-values.

### State Management

The screen uses a simple reducer hook, useSimpleReducer, to manage component state:

```javascript
const opacity = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current;
const tokenRef = useRef(token);

useEffect(() => {
  tokenRef.current = token;
}, [token]);
```
### Core Functions

- **getDeviceId**: Retrieves or generates a unique device ID and logs it with analytics.
- **getTimeZone**: Retrieves the device's time zone and logs it with analytics.
- **getData**: Coordinates data retrieval, device configuration, and navigation flow.
- **Animated.timing**: Handles the fade-in animation of the splash screen logo.

### Analytics

Logs key user events like app opening and device ID setup through AnalyticsService.

## Navigation
