# Home

The Home Screen is a React Native component designed to display key site statistics and a list of car washes. It allows users to view site data, refresh information, and sort the displayed car washes. The component interacts with APIs to fetch and update data dynamically. This document provides an overview of the code structure, functionality, and important elements of the Home Screen.

## Overview

The Home Screen allows users to:

- Sort the car washes list by various criteria.
- Interact with a modal to select sorting options.
- Display dynamic header images based on the time of day.
- View car washes data with details such as site, car count, labor percentage, and membership count.

## Code Structure

### Imports

### State Management

The screen uses the useSimpleReducer hook to manage the component's state:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  page: 1,
  limit: 50,
  carWashesData: [],
  isLoading: false,
  headerImage: '',
  isRefreshing: false,
  currentStatsData: defaultCurrentStat,
  headerColor: colors.white10,
  sortFilter: {},
};

const [state, updateState] = useSimpleReducer(initialState);
```
### Event Handlers

- **handleRefresh**: Triggered by the pull-to-refresh gesture to reload data (site listing, car washes, and current stats).
- **onPressOrder**:  Opens a bottom sheet for sorting options using ModalController.thentication process, including API call, error handling, and state updates.
- **onPressOptions**:  Placeholder function for additional options on the car washes list.

### API Integration

- **getSiteListAPI**: Fetches site listing data.
- **getData**:   Fetches current statistics and updates the UI.
- **getCarWashes**:  Fetches the car wash data and updates the list.
- **gupdateSiteListing**: Updates the site listing based on the selected location.

### Analytics

Logs events for API call successes and failures using AnalyticsService:ice.

```javascript
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.ALL_SITE_STATS_SUCCESS);
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.ALL_SITE_HOME_SUCCESS, { ...payload });
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.ALL_SITE_STATS_FAILED, {
  error: error?.message,
});
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.ALL_SITE_HOME_FAILED, {
  error: error?.message,
  ...payload,
});
```
### Custom Hooks

- **useBackHandler**: Handles Android back button press to show a confirmation message before exiting the app.

### Dynamic Header Styling

The header image and color are updated based on the current time using the updateHeaderStyle function.

## Navigation

On interaction with the sorting options, a modal opens to allow the user to select sorting criteria.
