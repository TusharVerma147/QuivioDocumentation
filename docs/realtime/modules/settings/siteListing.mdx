## Code Structure

### Imports

The screen imports several utilities and components, such as:

- **Custom Components**: CustomButton, GeneralHeader, SearchInput, RadioInput, CustomLoader.
- **Hooks**: useAppSelector, useAppThunkDispatch, useSimpleReducer.
- **Redux**: userReducer, saveSiteList.
- **Services**: AnalyticsService, ModalController.
- **Utilities**: colors, regex, screenHeight, getHp, getWp, showSnackBar.
- **Third-party Libraries**: FlatList, ImageBackground, AsyncStorage.


### State Management

The component uses the useSimpleReducer hook for state management:

```javascript
const initialState = {
  data: [],
  selectedItem: {},
  searchQuery: '',
  isLoading: false,
};

const [state, updateState] = useSimpleReducer({
  ...initialState,
  selectedItem: params?.selectedLocation || selectedLocation,
});
```

### Event Handlers

- **getData**: Fetches the site data and updates the state with the list of available locations.
- **onSiteSelection**: Updates the user's current location and saves the timezone to local storage.
- **saveSiteLocation**: Sends the selected site data to the backend and updates the Redux store if needed.
- **saveSiteLocation**: Sends the selected site data to the backend for saving using the saveSiteList API call.
- **ufilteredData**: Dynamically filters the site list based on the search query.


### API Integration

- **saveSiteList**: Saves the selected site location through an API request.
- **AsyncStorage**: Stores the selected site's timezone locally for quick access.


### Analytics

The component tracks user interactions using AnalyticsService:

```javascript
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.CURRENT_SITE_UPDATED_SUCCESS);
AnalyticsService.logEvent(EVENTS.SEARCH_DEFAULT_SITE, { searchQuery });
```


### Dynamic Filtering

The search functionality uses a regular expression to filter the site list based on the user's query:

```javascript
const filteredData = () => {
  if (searchQuery === '') {
    return data;
  }
  const q = new RegExp(regex.escapeRegExp(searchQuery.trim()), 'i');
  return data.filter((item) => q.test(item.name) || q.test(item.site_id) || q.test(item.code));
};
```


## Conclusion

The Site Listing Screen  simplifies site selection and management. It integrates with APIs for data fetching and saving, offering features like dynamic search, analytics, and responsive design.
